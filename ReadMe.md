This project was created to help a librarian at my church use a library application that was better suited for her needs. The emphasis on placed on having a simple design that included everything on one window (minizing the issue that the previous application had with many windows and tabs) and reduced latency when accessing the database. A sample window of the project has been included (note: not all data has been uploaded).
